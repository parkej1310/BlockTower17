"Garden Defense" is an animation game inspired from 'Plants vs Zombies'. 

How our game works:

As seen in the class diagram there is a class called GameCharacter which has all the basic attributes that all the other animations
would have in the game. Then from that there is a sub-class Plants which is the super-class of the classes: PeaShooter, Wallnut, 
FrozenPeashooter, CherryBomb and Sunflower. Each of these classes are slightly different in things like abilities, health and attack.

There is also another sub-class of GameCharacter which is called Zombie and this is the super-class of ConeHeadZombie, FootballZombie
and FlagZombie. Each of these classes are also slightly different in things like speed and health.

For our first demo we have a text-based version. For this we have the class PlantsVsZombies in which we have the 5x9 2-d array that
stores objects of the class Plants and is called Garden which is basically the garden in which the different plants can be placed and
the method prints a visual of the Garden in the console. In this demo where we have the MainClass in which we create a object called 
level1 from the PlantsVsZombies class. In this the user is prompted whether they want to play the game and the user has the option of 
typing in 'y' or 'n'. If 'n' is entered then the program will end and if something other than these two options are entered the user 
will be prompted again. When 'y' is entered the user is prompted which plant they want to add and in which row(0-4) and column(0-8). 
After, the console will print out a visual of the garden with the first character of the plant added in the row and column chosen.
